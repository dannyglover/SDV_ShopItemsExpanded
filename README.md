# [CP] Shop Items Expanded

Shop Items Expanded is a mod for Stardew Valley that adds more items for sale in various shops. Every item listed below is configurable. You can enable/disable each individual item for sale, as well as their price.

### Notes

- Any item/machine that has a crafting recipe will not be listed in a shops inventory until you've unlocked the crafting recipe for the respective item.
- Some items are not listed in shop inventories until you've completed a certain task (generally unlocking/visiting a location once). Those items have the requirements listed next to their entries below.
- Musuem items in the Traveling Cart are removed from sale once the Musuem has been completed. This is due to it making no sense for them to remain for sale once the Museum has been completed.

### Requirements

This mod requires Content Patcher v2.2 (or above)

### Requests

I'm open to requests. If you want more items added, just leave a comment that specifies the item you want to add, along with the shop you believe it should be added to.

#### FAQ

Q) Why lock items behind requirements?

A) This mod isn't intended as a cheat mod, or to be used as a way to obtain items early. It is purely intended as a helper. It helps you buy items that aren't usually for sale, after you've acquired the ability to craft them. This only applies to items that have crafting requirements of course. Other items are locked until you've visited a certain place.

Q) Why are the prices for the Museum items so high?

A) I did this, as again, the idea behind selling these items is for folks who just cannot acquire a small number of items to finish their musuem collection. So again, it's a helper, not a bypass. 

You can change the prices yourself however in-game, by using the Generic Mod Menu mod.
